# Python-Challenge

### I designed this Challenge for my wife and my young sister: Learn Python in Depth in 12 weeks!!

### Prerequisites
* A passion to learn Computer Science.

## Index
 - **[Week 1 - Introduction](https://github.com/quangvu0702/Python-Challenge/blob/master/README.md#week-1---introduction)**
 - **[Week 2 - Python Basic](https://github.com/quangvu0702/Python-Challenge/blob/master/README.md#week-2---python-basic)**
 
## Week 1 - Introduction:
  - Videos:
    - Goals: Learn to know what python can do and how they do it.
    - Key words: list, tuple, for, while, if-else, string.
    - All videos in [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program). Don't worry if you don't understand every line of code. You just need to understand the purpose of modules or functions. And we will comback later to understand every line of code.
  - Hands on:
    - Goals: Create a "hello world" on python.
    - Key words: colab, python2, python3, conda
    - Follow instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEIc9z-Ad3k&vl=en) or [this article](https://medium.com/@margaretmz/running-jupyter-notebook-with-colab-f4a29a9c7156) to create a "hello world" in python.
 
## Week 2 - Python Basic:
  - Goals: code what you have learn.
  - Key words: function, variable.
  - Exercises - It is ok if you don't understand some complexed lines of code, just ignore it, we will comeback later:
    - [Variables](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial/blob/master/basics/variables.md) takes 1 hours.

    - [String](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial/blob/master/basics/handy-stuff-strings.md) takes 2 hours.
    - [List and tuples](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial/blob/master/basics/lists-and-tuples.md) takes 1 hours.
    - [Loops](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial/blob/master/basics/loops.md) takes 3 hours.
    - [Zip, enumerate](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial/blob/master/basics/trey-hunner-zip-and-enumerate.md) optional.
    - [Dict](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial/blob/master/basics/dicts.md) takes 1 hours.
    - [Function](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial/blob/master/basics/defining-functions.md) takes 3 hours.
